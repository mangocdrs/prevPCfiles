this is a simple paragraph that is meant to be nice.
 and easy to type which is why there will be mommas.
 no periods or any capital letters so i guess this.
 means that it cannot really be considered a paragraph but.
 just a series of run on sentences this should help you get. 
faster at typing as im trying not to use too many difficult .
words in it although i think that i might start making it.
 hard by including some more difficult letters I'm typing .
pretty quickly so forgive me for any mistakes i think that.
i will not just tell you a story about the time i went to the zoo and found a monkey.
