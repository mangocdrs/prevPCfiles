             difference between innoDB and MYISAM

            innoDB :

1>row level locking
2>implements transaction,fk and relationship constraints
3>locks particular row in tha table
4>it provide the standard ACID-compilant transaction features along with the fk support
5>designed for high performance when processing large data
6>support fk thats why we call MYSQL with innoDB RDBMS
7>InnoDB stores its tables and indexes in a tablespace
8>InnoDB supports transaction. You can commit and rollback with InnoDB


            MYISAM
1>full table level locking
2>does not implement transaction, fk and relationship constraints
3>lock entire mysql table
4>designed for need for speed
5>does not support fk that why we call MYSQL with MYISAM DBMS
6>MyISAM stores its tables, data and indexes in diskspace using separate three different files. (tablename.FRM, tablename.MYD, tablename.MYI)
7>MYISAM not supports transaction. You cannot commit and rollback with MYISAM. Once you issue a command itâ€™s done.
